      <description> With a powerful Intel Celeron? 466MHz (w/128KB L2 Cache) processor the Presario
 5700 is good for everything. You can watch movies, play powerful games, browse the
 Internet at the highest speed available, do your everyday tasks, this computer is good at
 all this. It comes standard with a built-in 24x CD-ROM, huge 6.4GB hard drive (you
 will probably never use it all), internal 56K V.90 PCI Fax/Modem. This is a good
 advanced system, which is going to last forever. You can count on 5 and more years of
 work, there's plenty of 5 and more years old Compaqs that are still in use. Besides,
 Compaq has a very good technical support, so you won't have any problems looking for
 the drivers, for example. You can also order the quick restore CD, Compaq sends those
 for free.
